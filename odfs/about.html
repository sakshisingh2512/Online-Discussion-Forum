students by providing a student forum where the students can communicate and
share their ideas or queries related to a particular topic. They might want to discuss
a particular assignment that they are currently on or get answers to a question that
they know they will receive a direct response for. So we are creating an open forum
platform for students of a particular college where they can discuss there issues with
their faculties along with the faculty of other department, alumni and colleagues
within the college. So basically we are creating an environment in an individual
college where all students can come in a single shed and can ask their queries or
issues with the available person.
Through this platform professors can also communicate quickly and efficiently with
their students, since all the students are in one place. For students however, this will
be very beneficial as they can ask their queries anytime or whenever they face
difficulty in any topic.Â <br></p>
